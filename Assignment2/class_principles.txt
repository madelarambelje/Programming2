Object Oriented Design

- Model the world/ Problem Space
- object: "thing" (code) that does operations
- class: definition of an object (blueprint)
- object composition: objects containing object --> member variables
- class inheritance: redirecting to superclass(the class above the inherited class)
- interfaces: public methods objects can use
- encapsulation: internal implementation of variables that are hidden

Principles:
- DRY
- Single repsonsibility principle
- Composition over Inheritance
